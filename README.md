An web application built with React, Firebase Authentication, Redux Toolkit, Stripe, and Tailwind CSS. 
It offers user authentication, product browsing, cart management, payment integration and responsive design.

**Project Overview**
This initiative represents a comprehensive platform that enables users to register and log in using either their email/password or Google accounts.
Users can explore products, conduct searches, apply filters by categories, and sort items based on price, rating, and popularity. 
Detailed product information is available, along with suggestions for similar products. Users can add items to their shopping cart, modify quantities, and remove products as needed. 
The platform ensures that cart items are retained even after page reloads through the use of localStorage.
Purchases can be finalized through integration with Stripe Payment, and users will receive an order confirmation following a successful transaction.
